# Pathfinding System
This is a Python-based program that implements various algorithms to find the shortest path from start to end point in a 2D maze. The implemented algorithms include A*, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Uniform-Cost Search (UCS).
Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository onto your local machine using Git.
git clone https://github.com/your_username/pathfinding-system.git
Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed:
Python 3.x
Pygame library
You can install pygame library by running:
pip install pygame
Usage
Open terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
To run the program, enter:
python main.py
Select one of three pathfinding algorithms (A*, BFS, UCS) from menu options.
Input maze layout along with starting and ending points on console as prompted.
Program will output optimal path on maze graphically using Pygame graphics library.
